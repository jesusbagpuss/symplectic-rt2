<!-- 
  NB Elements allows you to select a licence variant (CC BY, CC BY-NC etc.), but not a full version - CC BY v4

  These values are the ones that match the EPrints3.4 default config.
  If you have added support for additional licences, add their codes below.
  EPrints3.4 also lists 'cc_gnu_gpl' and 'cc_gnu_lgpl' which /might/ map to
  the Elements GPL options
